## 💡 My Project Idea | 我的项目想法

### Project Name (if you have one) | 项目名称（如果你有的话）

Smart Environment Monitor

### What do I want to make? | 我想做什么？

*Describe your project idea in 3-5 sentences*  
*用 3-5 句话描述你的项目想法*

I want to create an environmental monitoring system that tracks temperature, humidity, and air quality. The device will display real-time data on an LED screen and send alerts when conditions fall outside optimal ranges. It could be used in homes, classrooms, or workspaces to help maintain healthy environments.

### Why do I want to make this? | 为什么想做这个？

*What problem does it solve? What excites you about it?*  
*它解决什么问题？什么让你对它感到兴奋？*

This project solves the problem of not knowing when indoor air quality needs attention. I'm excited about combining multiple sensors and creating something practical that people can actually use in their daily lives. It's a perfect blend of hardware, software, and real-world impact.




### What technologies or tools might I need? | 我可能需要什么技术或工具？

*It's okay if you're not sure yet!*  
*如果你还不确定，没关系！*

- [x] Arduino
- [x] ESP32

## 🎯 My 6-Day Goals | 我的 6 天目标

### What does success look like for me at the end of this course? | 课程结束时，成功对我来说是什么样的？

Success means having a working prototype of my environmental monitor project, feeling confident in my ability to build and troubleshoot Arduino projects, and having a solid foundation to continue learning independently. I also want to have documented my journey well so I can share it with others.

### Specific goals for each day | 每天的具体目标

- **Day 1**: Get comfortable with Arduino basics and complete my first circuit
- **Day 2**: Learn to work with sensors and read data successfully
- **Day 3**: Integrate multiple components and display data
- **Day 4**: Add advanced features and improve code structure
- **Day 5**: Troubleshoot issues and refine the project
- **Day 6**: Complete documentation and present my working project
